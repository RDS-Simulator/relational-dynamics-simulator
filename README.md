# Relational Dynamics Simulator (RDS)

Conversational framework for strategic decision and relational conflict training.

## Overview

Relational Dynamics Simulator (RDS) is a structured simulation framework designed to model complex relational scenarios and decision-making under pressure.

The system aims to transform conversational interaction into a controlled training environment for strategic clarity, conflict management, and relational intelligence.

## Core Concept

RDS is not a generic chatbot interaction.

It is a structured relational simulation model based on:
- Role-defined conversational architecture  
- Scenario-driven decision environments  
- Multi-layer analytical feedback  
- Strategic response modeling  

The objective is not conversation, but controlled decision training through structured interaction.

## Use Cases

RDS can be applied in:

- Executive decision training  
- Conflict management simulation  
- Leadership response modeling  
- High-pressure negotiation scenarios  

Designed for professionals operating in complex relational environments.

## Positioning

It is designed for professionals who need structured relational stress-testing of decisions before acting in real-world environments.

Built for:
- Executives and founders  
- Team leaders  
- Negotiators  
- Decision-makers operating under pressure  

Not intended for casual conversation or entertainment use.
