# Relational Dynamics Simulator (RDS)

Conversational framework for strategic decision and relational conflict training.

## Overview

Relational Dynamics Simulator (RDS) is a structured simulation framework designed to model complex relational scenarios and decision-making under pressure.

The system aims to transform conversational interaction into a controlled training environment for strategic clarity, conflict management, and relational intelligence.
## Core Concept

RDS is not a generic chatbot interaction.

It is a structured relational simulation model based on:
- Role-defined conversational architecture  
- Scenario-driven decision environments  
- Multi-layer analytical feedback  
- Strategic response modeling  

The objective is not conversation, but controlled decision training through structured interaction.
## Status

Work in progress.
